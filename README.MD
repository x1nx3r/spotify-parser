<h1>
Spotify Parser with py 
</h1>

i made this for my discord bot. for now there's not much and i'll do it again when i have some free time(anytime basically[f i haven't been touching this since last year]).

why python? yeah i know it's slow. but it's the only language easy enough to do for me rn. i'll port this to javascript when i've learned it or rust if i felt cute.
